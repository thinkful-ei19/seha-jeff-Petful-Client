## What does it do?
Well, Thanks for asking! Because you'll save a life. Each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet. The only thing you need to push the adopt button.
